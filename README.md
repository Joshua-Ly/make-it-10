# Make It 10 üéØ

**Make It 10** is a fast-paced arithmetic puzzle game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players are given four random digits and must use every digit exactly once, combined with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, or square root, to form an expression that evaluates to 10. The player has 5 minutes to solve as many puzzles as possible, with each correct solution resetting the current digit set.
